		I chose Nancy Douyon as my tech hero because of her philosophies on technology and leadership in technology,
		specifically in UX/UI In an interview, she describes UX design as an act of problem solving, rather than it
		being simply and art. Great design is made great because of what it does for the people using it. I also have
		great respect for her work in helping existing organizations step out of their existing patterns and look at
		design as a means toward inclusion. Her work consists of education organizations and tech leaders to help them
		take on that task of reinvention. At the core of her work is a desire to humanize technology and look forward
		toward a tech landscape with people and their needs at the center.
	</p>
	<p>At the core of her philosophy, Nancy Douyon is driven toward sustainable culture shifts that build real and
		lasting change while reducing tension and increasing profits. Her approach to this work aligns with my personal
		ideology surrounding change-making. She has accomplished so much and I appreciate that her perspective comes
		from a place of personal and professional experience.

	<h4>
		Nancy Douyon's accomplishments as a leader in her field include:
	</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>She was included as one of the "13 Brilliant Women Innovators And Subject Matter Experts Corporations Should
			Keep Their Eye On" in the Huffington Post. Inclusion in this list was based on three criteria.</li>
		<ol>
			<li>They have either increased the bottom line or identified new revenue streams for their companies.</li>
			<li>They are preparing their organizations to harness the future today in order to be more sustainable and
				relevant.</li>
			<li>They have lead innovation for at least three decades.</li>
		</ol>
		<li>She was quoted while working as Uber's head of International Design Research in the Forbes article "Amazon
			AI Exec: 8 Key Challenges To AI's Global Domination" and calling out how AI technology responds different
			(read: badly) to people with darker skin.
		<li>While she was working as a user experience researcher at Google, she was highlighted by KQED in a piece
			titled "Celebrating Bay Area Black Engineers"
	</ul>
	<p>And many more examples that can be found on her <a href="https://nancydouyon.com/press-media/">website<a></p>
	<hr>
	<p>With over 15 years of experience in the field, she has built her own brand called <a
			href=https://www.douyonsignature.com /><em>Douyon Signature</em></a> following The Douyon Strategy:
	<ol>
		<li>Profitable with inclusion</li>
		<li>Growth actualization</li>
		<li>Differentiators</li>
		<li>Incluversal design</li>
		<li>Future-proof</li>
	</ol>
	<p>I really appreciate how she brings profitability into the conversation while keeping it on the same level as
		inclusion. She believes that when we create inclusive design we are actually <em>increasing</em> profitability.
		She points out that engaging in a design process that includes the needs of an inclusive community has the
		potential to tap into previously untapped markets and underserved communities. In a tech world where the dollar
		reigns supreme, this is a brilliant way to push major organizations toward meaningful change while still keeping
		an eye on what is most important to them: profits.</p>
	<p>Additionally, I like her perspective on future-proofing design by thinking about potential disruption and looking
		toward innovation to guide design choices.</p>
	<hr>
	<p>Her experience at some of the world's biggest tech firms has established her as a leader and innovator in UX
		design. In learning more about her, I've been inspired to think more critically about how I might play a role in
		humanizing technology as I pursue careers in the tech space.</p>
	<p>In one interview, she said that coming from privilege can be a disadvantage in the UX design space because it can
		lead people to have a more limited perspective. Everyone is forced, to some degree, to understand the "norm" or
		the existing status quo, but for people who are a part of that, it is challenging to engage with other
		perspective. As someone who comes from that status quo, I think this is an important reminder that I will be
		less effective in the work I'm trying to do, and I will be capable of engaging with my audiences less well, if I
		don't take active steps to address this myopic view point. It's this understanding of what it takes to design
		great products with diversity in mind that I find the most activating as a tech professional.</p>
