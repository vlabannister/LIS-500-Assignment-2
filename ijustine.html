She branched out into more products and brands and built a multi-million following across YouTube and a variety of social media sites. Victoria admires that she proves that anyone can be tech-savvy, especially regardless of your gender. One of Victoria's favorite things that iJustine has done is to partner with Made With Code, an initiative by Google to introduce coding to middle school and high school girls and to encourage them to pursue STEAM education and careers.
