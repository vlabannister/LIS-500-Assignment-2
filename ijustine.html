        Justine Ezarik, more widely known as iJustine, is an American Youtuber and Tech Influencer. She started out as a
        content creator on YouTube in the late 2000s reviewing products such as the original iPhone. She branched out
        into more products and brands and built a multi-million following across YouTube and a variety of social media
        sites. Victoria admires that she proves that anyone can be tech-savvy, especially regardless of your gender. One
        of Victoria's favorite things that iJustine has done is to partner with Made With Code, an initiative by Google
        to introduce coding to middle school and high school girls and to encourage them to pursue STEAM education and
        careers.
